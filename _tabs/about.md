## About Me

  Hi, I’m **Abhinav Ananthu** — an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student at VJTI, Mumbai. I’m passionate about exploring the intersection of **machine learning, low-level systems, and         hardware acceleration**.

  I’ve contributed to open-source through the **Linux Foundation Mentorship (LFX)** and **Open Source Promotion Plan (OSPP)**, where I worked on upstream kernel fixes and embedded systems projects.           Recently, I built support for **running open-source ML models on Zephyr RTOS**, bridging real-time embedded systems with efficient ML inference.

  I’m always looking for exciting **projects in ML on low-level platforms** and opportunities to contribute to open-source communities pushing the boundaries of performance and efficiency.
